chore: Project cleanup for distribution readiness

Organized project structure and removed unnecessary files:

REMOVED:
- 2 backup panel files (results_panel_basic_backup.py, results_panel_enhanced.py)
- 24 NASTRAN analysis backup files (*.f04.*, *.f06.*)
- All Python cache (__pycache__/, *.pyc, *.pyo)
- Temporary screenshot (ss.png)

MOVED:
- 12 development documentation files → docs/archive/development_notes/
- demo_composite_sandwiches.py → tests/

RESULT:
- Clean root directory (3 .py files, 3 .md files)
- 0 backup files
- 0 temporary files
- 0 Python cache (outside venv)
- Organized documentation structure

Root directory now contains only:
- CLAUDE.md (project instructions)
- README.md (main docs)
- USER_GUIDE.md (user guide)
- main.py, run_gui.py, setup.py (entry points)
- DISTRIBUTION_READY.txt (this cleanup report)
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE_CLEAN.txt (structure documentation)

All recent enhancements included:
✅ Enhanced Results Panel with NASTRAN comparison table
✅ Aerodynamic method restoration from saved projects
✅ User-friendly method names and uncertainty bounds display

Ready for: Git push, PyInstaller build, production deployment
