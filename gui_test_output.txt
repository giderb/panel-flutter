No flutter bracket found in coarse sweep
CRITICAL: Significant aerodynamic heating at M=3.00, Alt=15.0 km
  Static temperature:   216.7 K (-56.5°C)
  Wall temperature:     566.1 K (292.9°C)
  Temperature rise:     349.4°C
  SAFETY IMPLICATION: Material properties will degrade significantly
  RECOMMENDATION: Apply temperature degradation to structural properties

[SUCCESS] GUI WORKFLOW TEST PASSED
================================================================================

The bug fix is working correctly!
[OK] Composite materials from GUI are correctly written to BDF
[OK] MAT8/PCOMP cards generated instead of MAT1/PSHELL
[OK] Material properties are correct (E1=171000 MPa, etc.)
